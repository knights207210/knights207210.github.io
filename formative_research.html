        <p>In this blog, I am gonna talk about two papers: <i><a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1055101"> Interaction in 4-Second Bursts: The Fragmented
Nature of Attentional Resources in Mobile HCI  </a></i> and <i><a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1357125"> A Diary Study of Mobile Information Needs   </a></i>. All these papers introduce various techniques for understanding user populations, which are really helpful in conducting user research for HCI design. </p>

        <h2 class="section-heading"> The Resource Competition Framework</h2>
        <p>The Resource Competition Framework (RCF) is introduced in paper <i><a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1055101"> Interaction in 4-Second Bursts: The Fragmented
Nature of Attentional Resources in Mobile HCI  </a></i>.  It is a framework built on the Multiple Resources Theory, explaining how psychosocial
tasks typical of mobile situations compete for cognitive esources and suggestting that this leads to the depletion
of resources for task interaction and eventually results in the breakdown of fluent interaction. In the paper, researchers conducted experiments with web search tasks as target assignment for users to accomplish. </p>

        <p>The reason why I choose this paper is because my previous HCI design experiences don't pay much attention on the psychology side of user studies while this paper borden my mind in terms of this field. On the other hand, our project idea -- an application for dog owners -- would require us to focus more on users' mobile scenarios. Our application allows dog owners to communicate with their dogs remotely. In this case, how mobile contexts (like users' driving their cars) would cause their shortages of cognitive resources will be of great importance when designing our app. </p>

        <p>This paper's methodology could also be of great use for our project. The table 1 concludes cognitive faculties relevant in mobile scenarios HCI design in great details, which is definitely useful in helping us have a more comprehensive design solution. At the same time, the route they constructed for their user studies is also very unique and enlightful. </p>
        




          <h2 class="section-heading"> Dairy Study </h2>
          <p>Dairy study is not totally new, but the dairy study conducted in this paper <i><a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1357125"> A Diary Study of Mobile Information Needs   </a></i> enlightened very useful design implications for mobile technology. These design tips is one of the reasons I choose this paper. What's more, the dairy study itself is clearly elaborated in this paper. How to design the experiment, how to conduct, how to collect data as well as how to analyze, all of them are recorded in great details.</p>

          <p> From this paper, we can definitely learn a lot by following its' experiment process and apply its design implications on our app design. For example, this suggestion is really helpful: <i>"mobile technology should take into account a personâ€™s current task and enable ways to address needs at later more convenient times."</i> In our app design, we would probably have a multi-tasking mode where users could always address their needs without too much cognitive resources costing. </p>
