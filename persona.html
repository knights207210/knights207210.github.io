        <p> I'm really excited about the readings of personas and task analysis, which greatly open my mind in terms of pre-design user studies and goal exploration, and I cannot wait to apply these ideas into an acutal HCD practice. Under this situation, the "shopping cart re-design" case from <a href="">"The Deep Dive" video</a> just jump in my head. In this blog, I will start a "mind experiment" -- what will I do in the shopping cart's pre-design process with concept of personas and task analysis ?   </p>

        <h2 class="section-heading"> Shopping Cart Personas</h2>
        <p>I created some possible personas based on the contents of interviews between the IDEO design team and stakeholder groups from the video. The whole process was so fun that I even fould it hard to stop. In this chapter, I am going to present some personas examples here. </p>

        <p><b>Emma: </b></p>

        <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-10 mx-auto">
        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/emma.png" alt="">
          </a>
          <span class="caption text-muted">Emma and her husband</span>
          </div>

          <p> " Hi I'm Emma, I am 87 this year. Every morning, Hank and I go to the WholeFoods across the street to do daily shopping, not only because we need to buy fresh foods everyday, but also we take this shopping thing into a routine. Both Hank and I love walking slowly hand to hand and talk about our daughters, dogs and neighbours. Rather than using baskets when shopping, we prefer the shopping carts since they are easier for us to move stuff with us around. However, current shopping carts still seem hard to move when we want to make a turn, the wheels seem to refuse to move sideways so Hank has to lift the front a little bit every time. It's fine now, but Hank does find the move more and more difficult to accomplish. "</p>


          <p><b>Monica: </b></p>

        <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-10 mx-auto">
        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/monica.jpg" alt="">
          </a>
          <span class="caption text-muted">Monica drags her huge shopping cart everywhere</span>
          </div>

          <p> " I hope so much somebody would come to give me a hand. " Monica, a 30-year old mom just says that to herself. Monica is a successful business woman as well as a mom to 3 children. She is pretty busy in normal days so she only goes to the WholeFoods twice a month and get everything the whole family need within one time. Unfortunately, every shopping experience for Monica is like 3 times harder and tireder than her job work. " I really wish I don't need to carry everything with me when I try to find where paper towel is,  it's exhausting. "  </p>

          <p><b>Jane: </b></p>

        <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-10 mx-auto">
        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/storeowner.jpeg" alt="">
          </a>
          <span class="caption text-muted">Jane and her store</span>
          </div>

          <p> Jane is a store owner. "5-7 pm is usually the busiest time of a day. All the checkouts are open but people still find it too time-consuming to wait in such a long line." As stated, one of her biggest problems in running this store is the checkout traffic jam. "People complain a lot about this, some of them even choose to shop online instead, this greatly influence our revenue. " Under this situation, Jane expressed her expectation that whether the shopping cart re-design program could help her solve this problem.  </p>


        




          <h2 class="section-heading"> Task Analysis when It Comes to Shopping Cart Re-design </h2>

          <p>From the reading, we can see that task analysis gathers both declarative (objects and relationships) and procedural ( task sequences, goals and subgoals) knowledge. When it comes to the shopping cart case, we can make a list of physical and perceptual actions of store buyers while using the cart to finish a shopping process: </p>
          <p>grab a cart at the store entrance</p>
          <p>push the cart to the fruit region</p>
          <p>pick up a bag of apple and put it into the cart</p>
          <p>push the cart to the seafood region</p>
          <p>get a bag of shirmp</p>
          <p>push to the checkout and checkout</p>
          <p>push to the parking lot and unload the stuff</p>
          <p>return the cart</p>

          <p>Comparing to frequent store buyers, first-time shopping cart users might take more time in step "checkout". But it is hard to say, strong user studies are needed for a solid task analysis, which I am excited to do if there's a chance. </p>


          <p> To get more familiar with task analysis, I built my own task model out of my coursework about Yelp dataset visualization. I will sketch and show more details in the following section. </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading"> Task Model on Yelp dataset visualization </h2>

          <p>In my coursework for INFO 4602 (Information Visualization), we built a website for users to get a better understand of Yelp dataset through visualizations. You can check the website <a href = "http://creative.colorado.edu/~wemi4704/projects/vis/final/Submission/"> here</a>.  </p>

          <p>The task goal is to better understand Yelp dataset. And here are some subgoals, including (1) find out which restaurant category, state has the highest rating, (2) which word tends to appear most in 5-star review, (3) which threshold generates best-performance prediction model, (4) which feature tends to contribute most in prediction and (5) how the decision tree model makes the prediction.</p>

          <p>Whit these goals, I sketched a task model like the following: </p>
